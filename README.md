# 🧠 SOC Project - Image Segmentation

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains my work for the Seasons of Code (SOC) project focused on **Image Segmentation**. The main objective was to learn and implement semantic segmentation using deep learning, with potential applications in areas like self-driving cars. Throughout the project, I progressively built my understanding of Python, machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision.
